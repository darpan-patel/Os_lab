#1.Write a Shell script to accept a string as command line argument and reverse the same.

len=`echo $1 | wc -c`
len=`expr $len - 1`
rev=""
while test $len -gt 0
do
rev1=`echo $1 | cut -c$len`
rev=$rev$rev1
len=`expr $len - 1`
done
echo $rev












#2.Write a shell script to check if the input string is a palindrome.

echo "Enter string to check palindrome:"
read str

len=`echo $str | wc -c`
len=`expr $len - 1`
rev=""
while test $len -gt 0
do
rev1=`echo $str | cut -c$len`
rev=$rev$rev1
len=`expr $len - 1`
done

if [ "$rev" == "$str" ]
then
echo "Sequence is palindrome"
else
echo "Sequence is not palindrome"
fi



#3.Write a shell script to accept a number and a word as command line arguments and print the word the given number of times on each line.
cnt=0; 
while test $cnt -lt $2
do
echo "$1"
cnt=`expr $cnt + 1`
done






#4. Write a shell script to find the file or directory with the maximum size in the current directory.
find . -maxdepth 0 -printf '%s %p\n'|sort -nr|head -v








#5.Write a shell script to accept two filenames and check if both exist. If the second filename exists, then the contents of the first filename should be appended to it. If the second filename does not exist then create a newfile with the contents of the first file.

echo "enter the first file:"
read file1
echo "enter the 2nd file:"
read file2
if [ -e $file1 ]
then echo "file1 is there"
else
echo "file1 is not there"
fi
if [ -e $file2 ]
then 
	count=1
	echo "file2 is there"
else
	echo "file2 is not there"
fi
if [ $count -eq 1 ]
then cat $file1 >> $file2
else cat $file1 > $file2
fi

#6. Write a shell script to accept a number in the command line and displays the sum up to that number. By default, the sum up to 50 should be displayed.

if [ $1 -eq " "]
echo "1225"
else
echo "($1 * ($1 + 1)) / 2" | bc
fi


#7. Write a shell script to accept an alphabet from the user and list all the files/directory starting with that alphabet in the current directory.
echo Enter character
read c
for i in `ls`
do
 x=`echo $i|cut -c 1`
if [ $x = $c ]
then echo $i
fi
done
