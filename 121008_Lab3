Q2:

#1. Write a shell script to scan two variables and to display their sum, mul, div, sub and modulo division.

echo "Enter One number:"
read num1

echo "Enter another number:"
read num2

echo "Addition($num1+$num2):"`expr $num1 + $num2`
echo "Subtraction($num1-$num2):"`expr $num1 - $num2`
echo "Multiplication($num1*$num2):"`expr $num1 \* $num2`
echo "Division($num1/$num2):"`expr $num1 \/ $num2`
echo "Modulo($num1%$num2):"`expr $num1 \% $num2`




#2. Write a shell script to perform all Arithmetic Operations using Command line arguments.

echo "Addition($1+$2):"`expr $1 + $2`
echo "Subtraction($1-$2):"`expr $1 - $2`
echo "Multiplication($1*$2):"`expr $1 \* $2`
echo "Division($1/$2):"`expr $1 \/ $2`
echo "Modulo($1%$2):"`expr $1 \% $2`



#3. Write a shell script to scan two variables and to display their sum, mul, div, sub and modulo division as per the user choice. (no need to continue, only once is OK)

echo "CHOICES"
echo "1.Sum   2.Sub   3.Multiply   4.Division"

read -p "Enter number1:" num1
read -p "Enter number2:" num2

read -p "Enter choice:" ch
if [ "$ch" == 1 ]
then echo "$num1+$num2"`expr $num1 + $num2`

elif [ "$ch" == 2 ]
then echo "$num1-$num2"`expr $num1 - $num2`

elif [ "$op" == 3 ] 
then echo "$num1*$num2 is "`expr $num1 \* $num2` 

elif [ "$op" == 4 ]
then echo "$num1/$num2 is "`expr $num1 \/ $num2`

fi



#4. Write a shell script to find greatest of two. Script must consider the case where two numbers are equal.

echo "Enter number 1:"
read num1

echo "Enter number 2:"
read num2

if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]
then echo "$num1 greater than(>) $num2"

elif [ $num1 -lt $num2 ]
then echo " $num1 smaller than(<) $num2"

else echo " $num1 equal(=) $num2"

fi



#5. Write a shell script to accept numbers below 50 and to display the square of each. This should continue as long as the user wishes.

while [ 1 ]
do
echo "Enter number below 50:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 50 ]
then echo "Enter number less than 50 " 
continue
else 
echo " Square of $num is" `expr $num \* $num`
fi
done



#6. Write a shell script, which scans the name of the command and executes it.

echo "Enter command you want to execute:"
read comm
$comm




#7. Write a shell script which displays January if we enter Jan, Janu, Janua or January.(use of case)

echo "Enter month name:"
read month

case "$month" in
"Jan") echo "January"
;;
"Janu") echo "January"
;;
"Janua") echo "January"
;;
"January") echo "January"
;;
*) echo "Not January month"
;;
esac



#8. Write a shell script to generate Fibonacci series.

fib3=0
fib1=0
fib2=1

echo " Enter number:"
read n
echo -n "$fib1 "
echo -n "$fib2 "
while((fib3<n))
do
fib3=`expr $fib1 + $fib2`
echo -n "$fib3 "
fib1=$fib2
fib2=$fib3
done
echo -e "\n"


#rite a shell script that asks the capital of Gujarat and repeats the question until the user gives correct answer.

while [ 1 ]
do
read -p " Enter capital of Gujarat:" cap
if [ $cap = 'Gandhinagar' ]
then
echo "You won 1 crore rupee :D :P"
exit 1
else
echo "Enter correct answer."
continue
fi
done



#10. Write a shell script program to search whether element is present in the list or not and also display its position in the list. 

list=(1 12 103 4 21 1210 007 121008 20 120)
read -p "Search your ID:" ID
for i in {0..9}
do
if [ "$ID" == "${list[$i]}" ]  
then
echo "Number found in the list "
echo  "Position" `expr $i + 1`
c=0
exit 1
else 
c=1
fi
done
if [ "$c" == 1 ]
then
echo "value not found"
fi
